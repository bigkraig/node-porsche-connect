## Credits
Thanks to the guys at [Driven App](https://github.com/driven-app/porsche-connect) and [pyporscheconnectapi](https://github.com/CJNE/pyporscheconnectapi) for their work in Swift/Python, on which this repo is based.

This package is provided as a small hobby project. Once everything is up and running in my setup at home, my motivation to maintain this repo might drop, so contributions are very welcome!
